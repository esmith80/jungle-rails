  In 1894, Edith Clarkeson became the first woman to own a business in the small town of Briar, North Haverton. 
  Edith's business consisted of repairing automatic bread toasters for the rich and famous. Toaster repairs were costly, 
  as the machines were very expensive and extremely dangerous to work with as they relied on quantum crystalization as a power source. 
  However, Edith quickly realized that the cost of producing and operating toasters would drop significantly with the advent of peeky 
  droplet technology. Anticipating the shift to cheap toasters for the masses, Edith convinced Ron Shipppydoohangle from IOU Bank to loan 
  her $10,000 to purchase an initial inventory. This was the beginning of a retail empire. Looking at Jungle today, 
  you&lsquo;d never suspect that we started as a small toaster repair shop. </p>
